# Calendly Integration

FluenzR integrates with Calendly to let you insert booking links in your emails and track each contact's appointments.

## Prerequisites

- A Calendly account (free or paid)
- At least one event type configured in Calendly

## Connect Calendly

### 1. Access integrations

1. Go to **Integrations**
2. Click on the **Calendly** tab

### 2. Authorize FluenzR

1. Click **Connect Calendly**
2. You are redirected to Calendly
3. Authorize FluenzR to access your account
4. You are redirected back to FluenzR

Once connected, FluenzR displays:
- Your Calendly username
- The list of your event types

## Event Types

### Automatic sync

FluenzR automatically retrieves your Calendly event types:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Name** | Event type name (e.g., "30min Discovery Call") |
| **Duration** | Appointment duration in minutes |
| **Link** | Booking URL |

### Copy a link

To copy the booking link for an event type:

1. Find the desired event type
2. Click the **Copy** icon
3. The link is copied to your clipboard

## Using Calendly in Your Emails

### Calendly Variable

Insert a Calendly link in your emails with the variable:

```
{{calendly_link}}
```

This variable will be replaced with the link to your first active event type.

### Usage Example

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I'd love to chat about your needs.

Book a slot directly in my calendar: {{calendly_link}}

Talk soon,
```

### Best Practices

- Place the Calendly link after presenting your value proposition
- Use a clear CTA like "Book your slot" or "Let's schedule a call"
- Mention the appointment duration to reassure the prospect

## Appointment Tracking

### Contact View

In a contact's profile, the **Calendly** section displays:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Upcoming meetings** | Scheduled appointments with this contact |
| **Past meetings** | Appointment history |
| **Status** | Scheduled, Canceled, No-show |

### Schedule an Appointment

From a contact's profile:

1. Find the **Meetings** section
2. Click **Schedule**
3. Select an event type
4. A new tab opens with Calendly
5. The contact's email and name are prefilled

### Appointment Statuses

| Status | Description | Color |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Scheduled** | Confirmed appointment | Green |
| **Canceled** | Canceled appointment | Red |
| **No-show** | Contact didn't attend | Orange |

## Synchronization

### Webhook (paid accounts)

If your Calendly account supports it, webhooks enable real-time sync:

- New appointment → Visible immediately
- Cancellation → Status updated automatically

### Manual Sync

For free Calendly accounts:

1. FluenzR syncs automatically every 15 minutes
2. Click the **Sync** icon to force an update

## Contact Linking

### Email Matching

FluenzR automatically links appointments to contacts:

1. When someone books a slot, Calendly sends their email
2. FluenzR searches for a contact with that email
3. If found, the appointment is linked to the contact

### Contact Not Found

If the attendee's email doesn't match any contact:
- The appointment is still recorded
- You can create the contact manually afterwards

## Disconnect Calendly

To disconnect your Calendly account:

1. Go to **Integrations** > **Calendly**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Confirm the disconnection

> **Note**
> Existing appointment data is preserved even after disconnection.

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to connect"

- Make sure you're logged into your Calendly account
- Temporarily disable your ad blocker
- Try in another browser

### Appointments not syncing

- Wait a few minutes, sync may take time
- Click **Sync** to force an update
- Verify the attendee's email matches a contact

### Calendly link not showing in email

- Check that you have at least one active event type
- Make sure you're using the `{{calendly_link}}` variable correctly
- Refresh the event types list in integrations

## Best Practices

### Event Naming

Use clear names for your event types:
- "15min Discovery Call"
- "30min Product Demo"
- "Meeting" (too vague)
- "Call" (too vague)

### Prospecting Sequences

1. **Email 1**: Introduction + value proposition
2. **Email 2**: Customer case study + Calendly link
3. **Email 3**: Follow-up with new availability

### Post-Appointment Follow-up

After an appointment:
1. Update the contact's status in the pipeline
2. Add notes about the conversation
3. Schedule the next follow-up if needed
