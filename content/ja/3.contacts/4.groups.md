# Contact Groups

Groups allow you to organize your contacts and precisely target your campaigns. FluenzR offers two types of groups: **static** and **dynamic**.

## Why Use Groups?

### Organization

- Classify your contacts by source (LinkedIn, Trade Show, Website)
- Separate by industry or company size
- Distinguish customers from prospects

### Targeting

- Create specific campaigns per segment
- Personalize your messages according to the group
- Measure performance by segment

### Management

- Easily export a segment
- Apply bulk actions
- Track the evolution of each group

## Types of Groups

FluenzR offers two types of groups to meet different needs:

### Static Groups

Static groups are the traditional method of managing contacts:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Manual addition** | Contacts are added manually or via import |
| **Persistence** | A contact remains in the group until explicitly removed |
| **Total control** | You decide exactly who is part of the group |
| **Use cases** | Fixed lists, CSV imports, one-shot segments |

### Dynamic Groups

Dynamic groups enable automatic enrollment in campaigns:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automatic enrollment** | New contacts automatically enrolled in active campaigns |
| **Real-time** | As soon as a contact is added to the group, they join linked campaigns |
| **Scalable** | Perfect for continuous flows (API, forms, enrichment) |
| **Use cases** | Inbound leads, automated workflows, continuous campaigns |

> **💡 Tip**
> Use dynamic groups for continuous nurturing campaigns where new contacts arrive regularly.

## Creating a Group

### 1. Access Creation

1. Go to **Contacts**
2. Click on **Groups** in the sidebar
3. Click on **+ New Group**

### 2. Configure the Group

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Group identifier | "LinkedIn Leads Q4" |
| **Description** | Explanatory note (optional) | "Contacts collected via LinkedIn in Q4 2024" |
| **Type** | Static or Dynamic | Dynamic |
| **Color** | Identification color | Blue |

### 3. Choose the Type

#### Static Group
Select **Static** if:
- You are importing a fixed list of contacts
- You want total manual control
- The list won't change frequently

#### Dynamic Group
Select **Dynamic** if:
- New contacts arrive regularly (API, forms)
- You want them to be automatically enrolled in campaigns
- You have continuous nurturing campaigns

### 4. Save

Click **Create** to finalize.

## How Dynamic Groups Work

### Automatic Campaign Enrollment

When a contact is added to a **dynamic** group:

1. FluenzR checks if active campaigns are linked to this group
2. If yes, the contact is automatically enrolled in these campaigns
3. The campaign workflow starts immediately for this contact

```
New contact → Dynamic group → Active campaign → Workflow starts
```

### Required Conditions

For automatic enrollment to work, the contact must:

- ✅ Have a valid email address
- ✅ Be in a **DYNAMIC** type group
- ✅ Have **ACTIVE** status
- ✅ Not already be enrolled in the campaign

### Workflow Example

1. You create a dynamic group "Inbound Leads"
2. You create a nurturing campaign and associate it with this group
3. You launch the campaign
4. Each new lead added to the group (via API, import, form):
   - Is automatically enrolled in the campaign
   - Receives the first email in the workflow
   - Progresses through the sequence

> **⚠️ Warning**
> A dynamic group can be linked to multiple active campaigns. Each new contact will be enrolled in **all** active campaigns linked to the group.

## Adding Contacts to a Group

### Method 1: At Creation

When creating or importing contacts, select the destination group.

### Method 2: From the Contacts List

1. Select contacts (checkboxes)
2. Click on **Actions** > **Add to group**
3. Select the group
4. Confirm

### Method 3: From the Contact Card

1. Open a contact's card
2. In the "Groups" section, click **+**
3. Select the group

### Method 4: Via API

For dynamic groups, the API is often the preferred method:

```bash
POST /api/v1/contacts
{
  "email": "new@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "groupId": "uuid-of-dynamic-group"
}
```

The contact will be automatically enrolled in active campaigns linked to the group.

## Removing Contacts from a Group

### From the List

1. Filter by the relevant group
2. Select contacts to remove
3. Click on **Actions** > **Remove from group**
4. Confirm

### From the Contact Card

1. Open the contact's card
2. In the "Groups" section, click the X next to the group
3. Confirm

> **ℹ️ Info**
> Removing a contact from a group does not delete them from FluenzR. They remain in your contact database.

## Using Groups in Campaigns

### Adding an Entire Group

1. Create or edit a campaign
2. Click on **Add contacts**
3. Select the **Groups** tab
4. Check the desired group(s)
5. Confirm

### Linking a Dynamic Group

For dynamic groups, the link with the campaign is particularly important:

1. Create a campaign and add the dynamic group
2. **Launch the campaign** (RUNNING status)
3. All new contacts added to the group will be automatically enrolled

### Excluding a Group

In some cases, you want to target one group but exclude another:

1. Add the main group
2. Click on **Exclude contacts**
3. Select the group to exclude

Example: Target "All prospects" but exclude "Current customers"

## Group View in Campaigns

In a campaign's detail view, the **Overview** tab displays:

- Contact groups with their statistics
- Number of contacts per group
- Open and click rates per group
- "Dynamic" badge for dynamic groups

Click on a group to see individual contacts and their metrics.

## Best Practices

### Naming

Use clear naming conventions:

| ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
|---------|--------|
| LinkedIn Leads 2024 | Group 1 |
| Active Customers | Test |
| Fintech Prospects | John |
| [DYN] Inbound Leads | Dynamic |

> **💡 Tip**
> Prefix your dynamic groups with [DYN] to easily identify them.

### Structure

Organize your groups logically:

```
By source:
├── [DYN] LinkedIn Inbound
├── [DYN] Website Form
├── TechDays Trade Show 2024
└── CSV Import January

By sector:
├── Fintech
├── SaaS
├── E-commerce
└── Services

By status:
├── [DYN] New Prospects
├── Qualified Prospects
├── Active Customers
└── Churned
```

### When to Use Each Type

| Situation | Recommended Type |
|-----------|-----------------|
| One-time contact import | Static |
| Continuous flow via API | Dynamic |
| Capture form | Dynamic |
| Event list | Static |
| Continuous nurturing campaign | Dynamic |
| One-shot campaign | Static |

### Maintenance

- Review your groups regularly
- Archive or delete obsolete groups
- Merge redundant groups
- Check campaigns linked to dynamic groups

## Bulk Actions on a Group

From a group's page, you can:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Export** | Download contacts as CSV |
| **Add to campaign** | Add all contacts |
| **Apply tags** | Add tags to all |
| **Delete** | Delete all contacts in the group |

> **⚠️ Warning**
> Deleting contacts from a group permanently removes them from FluenzR, not just from the group.
