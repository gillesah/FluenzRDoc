# Import contacts

FluenzR allows you to import hundreds or thousands of contacts in a few clicks via a CSV file.

## Prepare your CSV file

### Required format

Your CSV file must follow these rules:

- **Encoding**: UTF-8 (for accents)
- **Separator**: Comma (,) or semicolon (;)
- **First line**: Column headers

### Supported columns

| CSV Column | FluenzR Field | Required |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| `email` | Email | Yes |
| `firstName` | First name | No |
| `lastName` | Last name | No |
| `company` | Company | No |
| `jobTitle` | Job title | No |
| `phone` | Phone | No |
| `website` | Website | No |
| `[custom_field]` | Custom field | No |

### File example

```csv
email,firstName,lastName,company,jobTitle
john.smith@example.com,John,Smith,Acme Corp,Sales Director
mary.johnson@startup.io,Mary,Johnson,StartupIO,CEO
peter.williams@tech.com,Peter,Williams,TechCorp,CTO
```

## Import process

### 1. Access import

1. Go to **Contacts**
2. Click on **Import CSV**

### 2. Select the file

1. Click on **Choose a file** or drag and drop your CSV
2. FluenzR automatically analyzes the file

### 3. Map columns

FluenzR automatically detects columns, but you can adjust:

1. Verify that each CSV column corresponds to the correct FluenzR field
2. Use the dropdown menu to correct if needed
3. Select "Ignore" for irrelevant columns

### 4. Import options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Destination group** | Add all contacts to a group |
| **Tags** | Apply tags to all contacts |
| **Duplicate handling** | Ignore, update, or create anyway |
| **Consent source** | **Required** - How did you obtain these contacts |
| **Consent notes** | Additional information about the origin |

### 5. Document consent (required)

Before launching the import, you must **certify that you have consent** to contact these people. A confirmation checkbox is required.

Available consent sources:
- **Web Opt-in**: Contacts registered via your website
- **Event**: Contacts obtained at events
- **Business Card**: Professional exchanges
- **Social Network**: LinkedIn or other platform
- **Referral**: Recommended contacts
- **Existing**: Migration from another tool
- **Other**: To specify in notes

> **Important**
> The import will be blocked if you don't check the consent certification box. This measure ensures your GDPR and CAN-SPAM compliance.

### 6. Preview and validation

1. Review the preview of the first rows
2. FluenzR flags potential errors (invalid emails, etc.)
3. Fix issues or choose to ignore rows with errors

### 7. Launch import

Click on **Import** to start. A progress bar is displayed.

## Duplicate handling

When an email already exists, you have three options:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Ignore** | The existing contact is not modified |
| **Update** | Contact fields are updated with new values |
| **Create anyway** | Warning: Creates a duplicate (not recommended) |

> **Info**
Duplicate detection is based only on the email address (case insensitive).

## After import

### Import report

At the end of import, a report displays:

- Number of contacts imported
- Number of duplicates detected
- Number of errors (with details)

### Verification

1. Go to **Contacts**
2. Filter by the group or tag used during import
3. Check some random contacts

## Limits and performance

| Plan | Limit per import |
|------|------------------|
| Free | 300 contacts |
| Starter | 10,000 contacts |
| Pro | 50,000 contacts |

> **Warning**
For large imports (> 10,000 contacts), divide your file into multiple batches for better performance.

## Troubleshooting

### "Incorrect encoding"

Symptom: Unreadable special characters (é becomes Ã©)

Solution:
1. Open your file in Excel or LibreOffice
2. Save as > CSV UTF-8 format
3. Reimport

### "Email column not detected"

Solution:
1. Check that the first row contains headers
2. The header must be exactly `email` (lowercase)
3. Map manually if needed

### "Too many errors"

If more than 10% of rows have errors:
1. Download the error report
2. Correct your source file
3. Reimport only the corrected rows

### Stuck import

If the import seems stuck:
1. Wait a few minutes (large files take time)
2. Refresh the page
3. Check in Contacts if any contacts were added
4. Contact support if the problem persists

## Best practices

### Before import

- Clean your file (remove empty rows, fix errors)
- Validate emails with an external service if possible
- Prepare the groups and tags to use
- **Verify that you have consent from all contacts**
- Choose the appropriate consent source for traceability

### During import

- Don't close the window during import
- Note the expected number of contacts to verify

### After import

- Check the import report
- Test some contacts in a test campaign
- Keep a copy of your original CSV file
