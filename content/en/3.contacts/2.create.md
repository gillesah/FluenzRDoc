### 5. Document consent (required)

FluenzR requires you to document the consent source for each contact. This is a legal requirement (GDPR, CAN-SPAM):

| Consent Source | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Web Opt-in** | Contact registered via a form on your website |
| **Event** | Contact obtained at an event (trade show, conference) |
| **Business Card** | Contact obtained through business card exchange |
| **Social Network** | Contact obtained via LinkedIn or other professional network |
| **Referral** | Contact recommended by a third party |
| **Existing** | Contact already in your database (migration) |
| **Other** | Other source to specify in notes |
| **Not Specified** | Avoid - may cause compliance issues |

You can also add **consent notes** to document the collection circumstances more precisely.

> **Warning**
> Contacts without documented consent source may be excluded from certain mailings for compliance reasons.

### 6. Save

Click **Save** to create the contact.

## Custom fields

If you have created [custom fields](/docs/contacts/custom-fields), they appear in the creation form.

Example:
- Industry
- Company size
- Lead source

## Email validation

FluenzR automatically checks:

- **Format**: The email must be valid (format@domain.extension)
- **Uniqueness**: The email must not already exist in your database

> **Warning**
If the email already exists, you will receive an error message. Edit the existing contact or use a different email.

## Best practices

### Data quality

- Fill in as many fields as possible for better personalization
- Check the spelling of the first name (initial capital letter)
- Use the standard format for companies

### Organization

- Always assign to a relevant group
- Use tags consistent with your strategy
- Complete the pipeline if it's a qualified prospect

### GDPR & Compliance

- **Always document the consent source** (required in FluenzR)
- The consent date is automatically recorded
- Add notes if the source needs clarification
- Only contact people who have given their consent
- For CAN-SPAM compliance (USA), configure your physical address in settings

## After creation

Once the contact is created, you can:

- **Add them to a campaign**: From the contact page or when configuring the campaign
- **View their history**: Emails sent, opens, clicks, replies
- **Edit their information**: Click on the contact to edit their record
- **Qualify them**: Position them in the pipeline

## Quick creation from a campaign

You can also create contacts directly from a campaign's contact addition screen:

1. Open a campaign
2. Click on **Add contacts**
3. Click on **Create a new contact**
4. Fill in the quick form
5. The contact is automatically added to the campaign
