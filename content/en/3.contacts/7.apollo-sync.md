# Apollo.io Sync

FluenzR integrates with Apollo.io to let you import and sync your prospecting contacts easily.

## Prerequisites

- An Apollo.io account with an API key
- At least one contact in Apollo.io

## Setup

### 1. Get your Apollo API key

1. Log in to your Apollo.io account
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **API Keys**
3. Create a new API key or copy an existing one

### 2. Configure FluenzR

1. In FluenzR, go to **Integrations**
2. Click on **Enrichment (Apollo/Hunter)** tab
3. Paste your Apollo API key
4. Click **Save**

## Importing contacts

### 1. Access Apollo Sync

1. Go to **Integrations**
2. Click on the **Apollo Sync** tab

### 2. Select a list

FluenzR displays your available Apollo lists:

- **Lists with "Imported" badge**: Lists already synced with FluenzR
- **Lists without badge**: Lists not yet imported
- **"All contacts"**: Import all your Apollo contacts

### 3. Preview

After selecting a list, FluenzR shows:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **New contacts** | Contacts that don't exist in FluenzR yet |
| **Duplicates detected** | Contacts with an email already in FluenzR |
| **Total Apollo** | Total number of contacts in the list |

### 4. Handling duplicates

For each detected duplicate, you can choose:

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Skip** | The existing contact is not modified |
| **Update** | The contact fields are updated with Apollo data |

> **Tip**
> Use the "Skip all" or "Update all" buttons to apply the same action to all duplicates.

### 5. Destination group

Choose where to place imported contacts:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create new group** | A new group will be created with the Apollo list name |
| **Existing group** | Add contacts to an existing group |
| **No group** | Import contacts without assigning them to a group |

> **Info**
> You can customize the group name before importing.

### 6. Start import

Click **Import** (or **Sync** for already imported lists).

## Synchronization

### Re-sync a list

For lists already imported:

1. The list shows a green **Imported** badge and the associated group name
2. Click **Sync** instead of "Import"
3. New contacts are added, existing ones can be updated
4. The destination group is automatically pre-selected

### Change group name

During synchronization, you can modify the existing group name. The change will be applied automatically.

## Synced fields

The following fields are imported from Apollo:

| Apollo Field | FluenzR Field |
|--------------|---------------|
| `email` | Email |
| `first_name` | First Name |
| `last_name` | Last Name |
| `organization.name` | Company |
| `title` | Job Title |
| `phone_numbers[0]` | Phone |
| `linkedin_url` | LinkedIn URL |
| `city` | City |
| `country` | Country |

## Sync report

At the end of each sync, a report shows:

- Number of contacts **created**
- Number of contacts **updated**
- Number of contacts **skipped**
- Any errors (with details)

## Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Contacts per sync | Unlimited |
| Lists detected | First 10 pages of contacts |

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"

- Verify the API key is correctly copied
- Make sure the key hasn't expired in Apollo

### "Rate limit exceeded"

Apollo limits the number of requests per minute. Wait a moment and try again.

### Contacts without email

Apollo contacts without email are still imported but won't be able to receive email campaigns. Use enrichment to find their emails.

### Empty or missing list

FluenzR detects lists by analyzing your contacts' labels. If a list doesn't appear:

1. Verify contacts are assigned to that list in Apollo
2. Click **Refresh** to reload lists

## Best practices

### Before import

- Clean up your Apollo lists of obsolete contacts
- Define a naming strategy for your FluenzR groups
- Decide on your duplicate update policy

### Recommended organization

1. **One Apollo list = One FluenzR group** for easy tracking
2. Sync regularly to keep your contacts up to date
3. Use groups to segment your campaigns

### After import

- Spot-check a few contacts
- Run email enrichment on contacts without email
- Create a test campaign to a small sample
