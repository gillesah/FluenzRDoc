## General

### What is FluenzR?

FluenzR is a cold emailing platform that allows you to automate your prospecting campaigns while maintaining a personalized approach. Connect your email accounts (Gmail, Outlook, SMTP), create email sequences, and track your performance.

### Is FluenzR free?

FluenzR offers a limited free plan (1 email account, 300 contacts, 50 emails/day). For advanced features like warming, A/B testing, and more accounts, see our [paid plans](/docs/getting-started/plans).

### How is FluenzR different from other tools?

- Automatic warming included
- Affordable pricing
- Responsive support

## Email Accounts

### Which email providers are supported?

- **Gmail** (personal and Workspace) via OAuth

### Are my credentials secure?

- **Gmail/Outlook**: No password stored. We use OAuth, the most secure method.
- **SMTP**: Credentials encrypted with AES-256.

### Why do I see an "Unverified application" warning with Gmail?

Our Google certification is in progress. In the meantime, click "Advanced settings" then "Go to FluenzR". It's safe.

### How many emails can I send per day?

It depends on your provider:
- Personal Gmail: ~500/day
- Gmail Workspace: ~2000/day
- Personal Outlook: ~300/day
- Microsoft 365: ~10,000/day

FluenzR doesn't impose additional limits on Starter and Pro plans.

With multiple connected accounts (Starter+), FluenzR automatically alternates between them to distribute the load and avoid daily limits.

## Contacts

### How many contacts can I have?

- **Free**: 300 contacts maximum
- **Starter/Pro**: Unlimited

### How do I import my contacts?

1. Prepare a CSV file with at minimum an "email" column
2. Go to Contacts > Import CSV
3. Map the columns
4. Launch the import

[Detailed guide](/docs/contacts/import)

### What happens with duplicates?

During import, you can choose:
- **Skip**: The existing contact is not modified

### Are my contacts GDPR compliant?

FluenzR helps you comply with GDPR:
- Automatic unsubscribe management

But you remain responsible for the legal collection of email addresses.

## Campaigns

### How do I create an effective campaign?

4. Use 3-4 emails maximum
5. Space your follow-ups by 3-5 days

[Complete guide](/docs/campaigns/create)

## Deliverability
