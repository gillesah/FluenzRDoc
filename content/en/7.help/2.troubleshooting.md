2. Click "Reconnect" next to the account
3. Follow the OAuth process again
4. If the problem persists, delete the account and reconnect it

### "Gmail quota exceeded"

**Symptoms:** Emails no longer send, quota error.

**Solutions:**

2. Reduce sending volume
3. Add additional email accounts
4. Check if you haven't manually sent many emails

### "SMTP connection failed"

**Symptoms:** Unable to connect an SMTP account.

**Checks:**
1. Server and port correct?
2. Username = complete email address?
3. Password or App Password?
4. Encryption type (TLS/SSL) correct?
5. Is your firewall blocking the connection?

## Campaigns

### "Campaign blocked / Emails not sending"

**Symptoms:** Campaign is active but no emails are sending.

**Checks:**
1. Is the email account connected and active?
2. Are timing settings correct? (days, hours)
3. Are there contacts in the campaign?
4. Are contacts at "pending" status?

**Solutions:**
1. Check email account status
2. Reconnect the account if needed
3. Verify sending hours include the current time

### "Contact stuck in sequence"

**Symptoms:** A contact remains stuck at a step.

**Possible causes:**
1. The delay hasn't elapsed yet
2. The email account is in error
3. Sending hours don't match

**Solutions:**
1. Check the configured delay
2. Verify the campaign's timing settings
3. Reconnect the email account if needed

### "Variables not replaced"

**Symptoms:** `{{firstName}}` displays as-is in the email.

**Solutions:**
1. Check variable spelling
2. Use the variable menu rather than manual entry
3. Verify the field exists for the contact
4. Add a fallback: `{{firstName|there}}`

### "Emails sent but not tracked"

**Symptoms:** The "sent" counter stays at zero.

**Cause:** Statistics update delay.

**Solution:** Wait a few minutes and refresh the page.

## Contacts

### "CSV import failed"

**Symptoms:** Error during import or incorrect data.

**Checks:**
1. UTF-8 encoding?
2. First row = headers?
3. "email" column present?
4. No problematic special characters?

**Solutions:**
1. Open the CSV in Excel/LibreOffice
2. Save as "CSV UTF-8"
3. Verify the email column is named "email"
4. Remove empty rows

### "Email already exists"

**Symptoms:** Cannot create a contact, duplicate email.

**Solution:** Email must be unique. Edit the existing contact or use a different email.

### "Too many bounces"

**Symptoms:** High bounce rate, declining reputation.

**Solutions:**
1. Clean your contact list
2. Use an email validation service before import
3. Delete contacts with errors
4. Check your collection sources

## Deliverability

### "Emails in spam"

**Symptoms:** Your emails land in recipients' spam folders.

**Immediate solutions:**
1. Reduce sending volume
2. Enable warming (2-4 weeks minimum)
3. Simplify your content (fewer links, no images)
4. Personalize each email

**Long-term solutions:**
1. Configure SPF, DKIM, DMARC for your domain
2. Use a custom tracking domain (Pro)
3. Maintain good list hygiene
4. Keep warming active permanently

### "Declining reputation score"

**Symptoms:** Email account health indicator is declining.

**Causes:**
- Too many sends too fast
- High bounce rate
- Low engagement (opens, replies)
- Spam complaints

**Solutions:**
1. Temporarily reduce volume
2. Increase warming intensity
3. Improve list quality
4. Work on your content

### "Emails not delivered (soft bounce)"

**Symptoms:** Emails marked "soft bounce".

**Cause:** Temporary problem (full mailbox, server unavailable).

**Action:** FluenzR will automatically retry. If the problem persists, the contact will become a hard bounce.
