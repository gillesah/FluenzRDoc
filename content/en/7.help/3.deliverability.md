# Deliverability Guide

Deliverability is the ability of your emails to reach the inbox (not spam). It's the key factor in your campaign success.

## The fundamentals

### How does deliverability work?

Each email sent is analyzed by providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) according to several criteria:

1. **Sender reputation**: Your account's sending history
2. **Authentication**: SPF, DKIM, DMARC
3. **Content**: Spam words, links, images
4. **Engagement**: Open and response rates from recipients
5. **Behavior**: Sending volume and frequency

### The 3 possible destinations

| Destination | Meaning | Impact |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Inbox** | Goal achieved | Email seen and read |
| **Spam** | Filtered as unwanted | Rarely seen |
| **Bounced** | Not delivered | Never received |

## DNS Configuration

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

SPF indicates which servers are authorized to send emails for your domain.

**Check:**
```bash
dig TXT yourdomain.com
```

**Typical configuration:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM adds a cryptographic signature to your emails to prove their authenticity.

**Configuration:** Via your email provider (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, etc.)

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)

DMARC tells recipients what to do with unauthenticated emails.

**Typical configuration:**
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

### Check your configuration

- [mxtoolbox.com](https://mxtoolbox.com)
- [dmarcian.com](https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/)

## Sender reputation

### What is reputation?

It's a score assigned by providers based on:
- Sending history
- Spam complaint rate
- Bounce rate
- Recipient engagement

### How to build it?

1. **Start small**: 20-30 emails/day in the first weeks
2. **Increase gradually**: +20% per week if all goes well
3. **Enable warming**: Simulates positive engagement
4. **Maintain quality**: Good open and response rates

### Health indicators

| Indicator | Good | Warning | Critical |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| Bounce rate | <2% | 2-5% | >5% |
| Spam complaints | <0.1% | 0.1-0.5% | >0.5% |
| Open rate | >25% | 15-25% | <15% |

## Warming

### Why warm up your account?

A new or little-used email account has no established reputation. Warming:
- Generates positive activity
- Improves engagement signals
- Progressively builds reputation

### How does it work?

1. FluenzR sends emails to other accounts in the network
2. These emails are automatically opened and replied to
3. Sometimes removed from spam if necessary
4. This simulates natural, positive email activity

### Recommended duration

| Situation | Warming duration |
|-----------|------------------|
| New account | 2-4 weeks before prospecting |
| Little-used account | 1-2 weeks |
| Deliverability issues | 4-6 weeks intensive |

## Content best practices

### What to avoid

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| EXCESSIVE CAPITALS | Obvious spam signal |
| "FREE", "URGENT", "OFFER" | Spam trigger words |
| Too many links (>2) | Commercial signal |
| Images without text | Newsletter/ad signal |
| Large attachments | Suspicious for first contact |
| URL shorteners | Often used by spammers |
| Complex HTML | Mass mailing signal |

### What to do

| Element | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Personalization | Proves it's a real message |
| Simple text | Looks like a personal email |
| 1 link maximum | Discreet |
| Professional signature | Credibility |
| Questions | Natural engagement |
| Short and direct | Respects the recipient |

### Optimized email example

```
Subject: {{firstName}}, quick question

Hello {{firstName}},

I noticed that {{company}} is expanding its activity in
the {{sector}} sector.

We help similar companies automate their prospecting,
and I was wondering if this was a current topic for you.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to discuss?

Best regards,
John Smith

## List hygiene

### Regular cleaning

| Action | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Remove hard bounces | Immediately |
| Remove unsubscribes | Automatic |
| Archive non-engaged (6 months) | Monthly |
| Validate new emails | On import |

### Email validation

Before importing a list, use a validation service:
- [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io)
- [NeverBounce](https://neverbounce.com)
- [ZeroBounce](https://zerobounce.net)

This identifies:
- Invalid emails
- Spam traps
- Temporary/disposable emails

### Quality sources

| Source | Typical quality |
|--------|-----------------|
| Website opt-in | Excellent |
| Event forms | Good |
| LinkedIn (manual) | Good |
| Purchased list | Very poor |
| Non-targeted scraping | Poor |

## Volume and frequency

### Ramp up

| Week | Recommended volume |
|------|-------------------|
| 1 | 20-30/day |
| 2 | 40-50/day |
| 3 | 60-80/day |
| 4+ | 100+/day |

### Distribution throughout the day

- Don't send everything in 1 hour
- Spread throughout the day (FluenzR does this automatically)
- Avoid spikes

### Follow-up frequency

| Delay | Perception |
|-------|------------|
| 1 day | Too pushy |
| 2-3 days | Acceptable |
| 4-5 days | Ideal |
| >7 days | Loss of momentum |

## Monitoring and reaction

### Metrics to watch

| Metric | Alert threshold |
|--------|-----------------|
| Bounce rate | >5% |
| Open rate | <15% (declining) |
| Spam complaints | >0.1% |

### What to do if there's a problem?

**Sudden drop in opens:**
1. Immediately reduce volume
2. Check if account is blocked
3. Intensify warming
4. Review email content

**Bounce spike:**
1. Stop the campaign
2. Clean the list
3. Identify the source of bad emails
4. Resume with clean list

**Spam complaints:**
1. Stop sending to contacts in that segment
2. Review targeting
3. Improve message relevance
4. Clearly add contact context

## Legal Compliance (GDPR / CAN-SPAM)

FluenzR automatically includes compliance elements in your emails:

### Automatic Unsubscribe

Each email automatically includes:
- **Unsubscribe link**: A clickable link in the footer
- **List-Unsubscribe header**: Enables 1-click unsubscribe from Gmail/Outlook
- **List-Unsubscribe-Post header**: RFC 8058 compliance for one-click unsubscribe

> **Info**
> These headers are required by Google and Microsoft for bulk sending. FluenzR adds them automatically.

### Physical Address (CAN-SPAM)

The CAN-SPAM Act (USA) requires a physical address in every commercial email.

**To configure it:**
1. Go to **Settings** > **My Account**
2. Fill in the "Physical address" field
3. This address will automatically appear in the footer of your emails

> **Important**
> If you send emails to the United States, this address is mandatory. FluenzR automatically injects it into all your emails.

### Documented Consent

FluenzR requires documenting the consent source for your contacts:
- The source is required when creating and importing contacts
- The consent date is automatically recorded
- Notes can be added for more details
