# Email Accounts

FluenzR uses your own email accounts to send your campaigns. This ensures better deliverability and maximum authenticity for your messages.

## Why use your own accounts?

### Native authentication
Emails are sent directly from your address, with your DKIM and SPF signature. Recipients see your real email address.

### Better deliverability
No sending through suspicious third-party servers. Your emails go through Google or Microsoft infrastructures, recognized as reliable.

### Clear limits
You naturally respect your provider's limits, which prevents blocking.

## Supported providers

| Provider | Method | Daily limits |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Gmail** | OAuth 2.0 | ~500/day (personal), ~2000/day (Workspace) |
| **Outlook/Microsoft 365** | OAuth 2.0 | ~300/day (personal), ~10000/day (business) |
| **Custom SMTP** | Credentials | Depends on your server |

## Limits by plan

| Plan | Email accounts | Rotation |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Free | 1 | No |
| Starter | 3 | Yes |
| Pro | 12 | Automatic |

## Features

### Automatic rotation (Starter+)
With multiple connected accounts, FluenzR automatically alternates between them to:
- Distribute sending load
- Avoid daily limits
- Improve overall deliverability

### Email Warming (Starter+)
Automatic warming progressively "warms up" your email accounts to improve their reputation. [Learn more](/docs/email-accounts/warming).

### Response synchronization
FluenzR automatically detects responses to your campaigns and displays them in your Inbox.
