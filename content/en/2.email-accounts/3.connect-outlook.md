# Connect Outlook

FluenzR supports personal Outlook accounts and professional Microsoft 365 accounts via OAuth 2.0.

## Prerequisites

- An Outlook.com, Hotmail, or Microsoft 365 account
- Access to the email accounts page in FluenzR

## Connection steps

### 1. Access configuration

1. Log in to your FluenzR account
2. In the sidebar, click on **Email Accounts**
3. Click on the **+ Microsoft** button

### 2. Authorize access

1. A Microsoft window opens
2. Log in to your Microsoft account
3. Review the requested permissions

### 3. Grant permissions

FluenzR requests access for:
- **Mail.Send**: Send emails
- **Mail.Read**: Read emails (response detection)
- **User.Read**: Access your basic profile

Click **Accept** to confirm.

### 4. Verification

After authorization, your Outlook account appears in FluenzR with **Connected** status.

## Outlook limits

| Account type | Daily limit |
|--------------|-------------|
| Outlook.com / Hotmail | ~300 emails/day |
| Microsoft 365 Business | ~10,000 emails/day |

> **Info**
Professional Microsoft 365 accounts have much higher limits, making them ideal for prospecting.

## Microsoft 365 vs Outlook.com

### Outlook.com (personal)
- Free
- More restrictive limits
- Suitable for small volumes

### Microsoft 365 (professional)
- Paid (from €5.60/month)
- Custom domain possible
- High limits
- Centralized administration
- Better professional image

## Configuration for Microsoft 365

If you use Microsoft 365 with a custom domain, make sure that:

1. **SPF** is configured for your domain
2. **DKIM** is enabled in Microsoft 365 admin
3. **DMARC** is configured (recommended)

These DNS configurations improve your email deliverability.

## Troubleshooting

### "Access denied by administrator"
For Microsoft 365 accounts, your organization's administrator may block third-party applications:
1. Contact your IT administrator
2. Request FluenzR approval in Azure AD
3. Or use a personal account in the meantime

### "Authentication failed"
- Check that the account doesn't have blocking two-factor authentication
- Try logging out/logging back into Microsoft
- Use a private browser

### "Invalid token"
- In FluenzR, delete the account
- Reconnect it from the beginning
- If the problem persists, revoke access on Microsoft's side then reconnect

## Revoke access

To disconnect FluenzR from your Microsoft account:

1. Go to [account.microsoft.com/privacy/app-access](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/app-access)
2. Find "FluenzR" in the list
3. Click on **Remove these permissions**

## Gmail vs Outlook comparison

| Criteria | Gmail | Outlook |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Personal limit | 500/day | 300/day |
| Professional limit | 2000/day | 10000/day |
| Configuration | Simple | Simple |
| Deliverability | Excellent | Very good |
| Professional price | €5.75/month | €5.60/month |

> **Success**
For maximum flexibility, combine Gmail and Outlook accounts on your Starter or Pro plan.
