# Email Warming

Email warming is a technique that progressively improves your email account's reputation to maximize the deliverability of your campaigns.

> **Info**
> Warming is available starting from the **Starter** plan.

> **Important: Gmail Accounts**
> Automated warming is **not available for Gmail accounts**. Gmail API Terms of Service prohibit automated sending systems that simulate conversations. This feature is available for **Outlook/Microsoft 365** and **SMTP** accounts.

## What is warming?

### The problem

Email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) monitor sending behavior of accounts:
- An account that suddenly sends many emails is suspicious
- A low engagement rate (opens, replies) hurts reputation
- Too many unread emails can land you in spam

### The solution

Warming simulates natural email activity:
- Progressive sending of emails to other accounts in the FluenzR network
- Automatic opening of received emails
- Simulated replies to show engagement
- Removal of emails from spam if necessary

## How does it work?

### Phase 1: Startup (Week 1-2)

- 5-10 emails/day sent and received
- Automatic opens at 100%
- Some simulated replies

### Phase 2: Ramp-up (Week 3-4)

- 15-25 emails/day
- Maintained engagement
- Natural variations in timing

### Phase 3: Maintenance (Continuous)

- 20-30 emails/day in the background
- Constant activity to maintain reputation
- Automatic adjustment based on performance

## Enable warming

### 1. Access settings

1. Go to **Email Accounts**
2. Click on the account to warm up
3. Enable the **Warming** option

### 2. Configuration

| Option | Description | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Intensity** | Number of warming emails/day | Medium (20/day) |
| **Hours** | Sending time range | 9am-6pm |
| **Days** | Days of the week | Mon-Fri |

### 3. Launch

Click on **Start warming**. The system starts immediately.

## Best practices

### When to start warming?

- **New account**: Start immediately, wait 2 weeks before prospecting
- **Existing account**: Start and prospect in parallel (reduced volume)
- **Account in trouble**: Stop campaigns, intensive warming for 1 month

### Recommended duration

| Situation | Minimum duration |
|-----------|------------------|
| New account | 2-4 weeks |
| Little-used account | 1-2 weeks |
| Deliverability issue | 4-6 weeks |

> **Warning**
Do not disable warming during your active campaigns. It maintains your reputation permanently.

### Prospecting volume

During warming, limit your prospecting volume:

| Phase | Warming emails | Prospecting emails |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Week 1-2 | 10-20/day | 0-10/day |
| Week 3-4 | 20-30/day | 20-50/day |
| Week 5+ | 20-30/day | 50-100/day |

## Monitoring

### Health indicators

In the account dashboard, monitor:

- **Reputation score**: Rating from 0 to 100
- **Spam rate**: % of emails landing in spam
- **Engagement rate**: Opens and replies

### Alerts

FluenzR alerts you if:
- The reputation score drops significantly
- The spam rate increases
- Technical issues occur

## FAQ

### Is warming detectable?

The FluenzR warming network uses real email accounts with varied behaviors. The activity looks like normal professional exchanges.

### How long does it take?

- Visible effect: 1-2 weeks
- Established reputation: 4-6 weeks
- Maintenance: Continuous

### Can I prospect during warming?

Yes, but reduce volume in the first weeks. Warming and prospecting complement each other.

### What happens if I stop warming?

The account's reputation gradually degrades without positive activity. Keep warming active as long as you're prospecting.

### Which account types support warming?

Warming works with **Outlook/Microsoft 365** and **SMTP** accounts.

**Gmail is not compatible** with warming due to Gmail API Terms of Service. For Gmail accounts, see our guide on [natural reputation building](/docs/email-accounts/connect-gmail#natural-reputation-building).

## Troubleshooting

### "Warming inactive"

- Check that the account is properly connected
- Reconnect the account if necessary
- Contact support if the problem persists

### Declining reputation score

1. Check your ongoing campaigns
2. Reduce prospecting volume
3. Increase warming intensity
4. Wait 1-2 weeks

### Emails still in spam

- Warming takes time (4-6 weeks minimum)
- Check your DNS configuration (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Improve your email content
- Use fewer links and images
