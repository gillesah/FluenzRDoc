# Connect Gmail

Gmail is the recommended provider for FluenzR thanks to its reliability and good deliverability.

## Prerequisites

- A personal Gmail account or Google Workspace
- Access to the email accounts page in FluenzR

## Connection steps

### 1. Access configuration

1. Log in to your FluenzR account
2. In the sidebar, click on **Email Accounts**
3. Click on the **+ Gmail** button

### 2. Authorize access

1. A Google window opens
2. Select the Gmail account to connect
3. Click **Continue**

> **Warning**
**Unverified application**: You will see a warning "This app isn't verified by Google". This is normal during our certification process. Click on "Advanced settings" then "Go to FluenzR (unsafe)".

### 3. Grant permissions

FluenzR requests the following permissions:
- **Send emails**: To send your campaigns
- **Read emails**: To detect responses
- **View your email address**: To identify the account

Click **Allow** to confirm.

### 4. Verification

After authorization, you are redirected to FluenzR. Your Gmail account appears in the list with **Connected** status.

## Gmail limits

| Account type | Daily limit |
|--------------|-------------|
| Personal Gmail | ~500 emails/day |
| Google Workspace | ~2000 emails/day |

> **Info**
These limits are imposed by Google, not by FluenzR. Exceeding them can result in a temporary suspension of your account.

## Best practices

### Start gradually
Don't go from 0 to 500 emails/day immediately. Increase progressively:
- Week 1: 20-30 emails/day
- Week 2: 50-100 emails/day
- Week 3+: Increase based on results

### Natural reputation building
> **Note about warming**
> Automated warming is **not available for Gmail accounts**. Gmail API Terms of Service prohibit automated sending systems that simulate conversations.

To build your Gmail account reputation naturally:
- Gradually increase volume (see above)
- Respond quickly to received emails
- Maintain good engagement rates with your recipients
- Avoid sudden spikes in sending volume

### Use multiple accounts (Starter+)
With the Starter or Pro plan, connect multiple Gmail accounts to:
- Distribute the load
- Test different approaches
- Avoid blocking

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection failed"
- Check that pop-ups are not blocked
- Try with another browser
- Temporarily disable extensions

### "Quota exceeded"
- Wait 24 hours before trying again
- Reduce sending volume
- Add additional accounts

### "Token expired"
- Go to Email Accounts
- Click on **Reconnect** next to the affected account
- Redo the authorization process

## Revoke access

To disconnect FluenzR from your Gmail account:

1. Go to [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
2. Find "FluenzR" in the list
3. Click on **Remove access**

> **Warning**
Revoking access on Google's side does not delete the account in FluenzR. Remember to also delete it in the application.
