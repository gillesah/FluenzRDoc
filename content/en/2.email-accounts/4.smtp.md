# SMTP Configuration

For email providers other than Gmail and Outlook, FluenzR supports connection via SMTP.

## When to use SMTP?

- Self-hosted email server
- French email provider (OVH, Gandi, etc.)
- Professional email service (Zoho, ProtonMail Bridge, etc.)
- Specific configuration needs

> **Warning**
SMTP connection stores your credentials encrypted (AES-256). For maximum security, prefer OAuth (Gmail/Outlook) when possible.

## Required information

To configure SMTP, you will need:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **SMTP Server** | Outgoing server address | smtp.example.com |
| **Port** | Connection port | 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL) |
| **Username** | Usually your email | user@example.com |
| **Password** | Password or app password | ********** |
| **Encryption** | Security type | TLS (recommended) |

## Step-by-step configuration

### 1. Access configuration

1. Go to **Email Accounts**
2. Click on **+ SMTP**

### 2. Fill in the information

1. **Email**: Your complete email address
2. **Display name**: The name that will appear as sender
3. **SMTP Server**: Your server address
4. **Port**: Usually 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL)
5. **Username**: Often identical to the email
6. **Password**: Your password (or app password)
7. **Encryption**: Select TLS or SSL

### 3. Test the connection

Click on **Test** to verify that the configuration works. A test email will be sent to your own address.

### 4. Configure IMAP (optional)

For response detection, also configure IMAP:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **IMAP Server** | Incoming server address | imap.example.com |
| **Port** | Connection port | 993 (SSL) |

## Common configurations

### OVH Mail

```
SMTP: ssl0.ovh.net
Port: 587 (TLS)
IMAP: ssl0.ovh.net
IMAP Port: 993 (SSL)
```

### Gandi

```
SMTP: mail.gandi.net
Port: 587 (TLS)
IMAP: mail.gandi.net
IMAP Port: 993 (SSL)
```

### Zoho Mail

```
SMTP: smtp.zoho.eu (or smtp.zoho.com)
Port: 587 (TLS)
IMAP: imap.zoho.eu
IMAP Port: 993 (SSL)
```

> **Info**
For Zoho, you will need to generate an "App Password" in your account's security settings.

### Infomaniak

```
SMTP: mail.infomaniak.com
Port: 587 (TLS)
IMAP: mail.infomaniak.com
IMAP Port: 993 (SSL)
```

### ProtonMail (via Bridge)

```
SMTP: 127.0.0.1
Port: 1025
IMAP: 127.0.0.1
IMAP Port: 1143
```

> **Warning**
ProtonMail requires the Bridge application installed and active on your machine.

## App Passwords

Some providers require an "app password" instead of your main password:

### When to use an App Password?

- Two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled
- Provider's security requirement
- Organization policy

### How to generate one?

1. Log in to your provider's web interface
2. Go to Settings > Security
3. Look for "App passwords" or "Application passwords"
4. Create a new password for "FluenzR"
5. Copy the generated password into FluenzR

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused"

- Check the port and server
- Make sure your firewall is not blocking
- Test with another port (465 instead of 587)

### "Authentication failed"

- Check the username (often the complete email)
- Use an App Password if 2FA is enabled
- Check the case of the password

### "Invalid certificate"

- Make sure you're using the correct encryption type
- Contact your provider if the certificate has expired

### "Sending limit reached"

SMTP servers often have limits:
- Check your provider's limits
- Space out your sends
- Contact your host to increase quotas

## Security

### Credential storage

- SMTP credentials are encrypted in AES-256
- Never stored in plain text in the database
- Accessible only by the sending system

### Recommendations

1. Use a dedicated App Password
2. Enable login alerts with your provider
3. Change the password regularly
4. Prefer OAuth when possible
