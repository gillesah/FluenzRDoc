# Inbox

The FluenzR Inbox centralizes all responses to your campaigns for efficient tracking of your conversations.

## Overview

### Why a dedicated Inbox?

- **Centralization**: All responses in one place
- **Context**: See the campaign history for each response
- **Quick action**: Reply without leaving FluenzR
- **Organization**: Classify and prioritize responses

### How it works

1. A contact replies to a campaign email
2. FluenzR detects the response in your email inbox
3. The response appears in the Inbox
4. The sequence is automatically stopped for this contact

## Inbox interface

## Manage conversations

### Read a conversation

2. The detail panel opens on the right
3. View the complete history

### Displayed content

### Reply

1. Type your reply in the field at the bottom
2. Click **Send**

The reply is sent from the same email account as the campaign.

> **Info**
Your manual replies are not tracked like campaign emails. It's a normal conversation.

- Use keyboard shortcuts (R for read, U for unread)

### Archive

1. Click the archive icon
2. The conversation disappears from the default view
3. Find it in the "Archived" filter

## Conversation statuses

| Status | Description | Suggested action |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Unread** | New response | Treat as priority |
| **Read** | Seen but not replied | Follow up or archive |
| **Replied** | You've replied | Wait or follow up |
| **Archived** | Handled/finished | No action |

## Contact actions

From a conversation, quickly access:

### View contact card

Click on the contact name to open their complete card.

### Modify pipeline

Qualify the contact directly:
1. Click on the pipeline badge
2. Select the new stage

### Add to a campaign

If relevant, add the contact to another campaign:
1. Click **Actions** > **Add to a campaign**
2. Select the campaign

> **Warning**
Avoid adding a contact who just replied to a new automated campaign. Prefer a personal exchange.

## Best practices

### Reply quickly

Quick responses (<2h) have a better conversion rate. Check your Inbox regularly.

### Personalize your replies

Don't copy-paste generic responses. Reference elements from the contact's message.

### Systematically qualify

At each response, update the pipeline:
- Interested → Qualified
- Demo request → Proposal
- Not interested → Lost

### Archive properly

Archive finished conversations to keep a clear Inbox:
- "No thanks" → Archive (+ pipeline "Lost")
- "Maybe later" → Keep (+ reminder note)
- Deal closed → Archive (+ pipeline "Won")

## Notifications

### Email notification

Receive an alert for each new response:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Notifications**
2. Enable **New responses**
3. Choose the frequency (instant, daily digest)

### Browser notifications

Enable push notifications:
1. Click on the notification icon
2. Allow browser notifications

## Response detection

### How it works

FluenzR periodically scans your connected email accounts:
- Searches for incoming emails
- Analyzes the thread (In-Reply-To, References)
- Associates with the corresponding campaign

### Detection delay

| Account type | Average delay |
|--------------|---------------|
| Gmail | 1-5 minutes |
| Outlook | 1-5 minutes |
| SMTP/IMAP | 5-15 minutes |

### Undetected responses

If a response doesn't appear:
- The contact may have created a new thread (not a reply)
- Check your email client directly
- Synchronization may be delayed

## FAQ

### Can I reply from my email client?

Yes, but the response won't appear in the FluenzR Inbox. For complete tracking, reply from FluenzR.

### Are attachments supported?

Received attachments are displayed and downloadable. You can also send attachments in your replies.

### Can I forward a conversation?

Not directly in FluenzR. Forward from your email client if necessary.

### How to handle out-of-office replies?

Automatic responses (vacation, OOO) also appear in the Inbox. You can archive them directly with no impact on the campaign.
