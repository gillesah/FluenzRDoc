# Variables and personalization

Variables allow you to automatically personalize your emails with each contact's information.

## Why personalize?

### Better open rate

A personalized subject gets 26% more opens than a generic subject.

### Better engagement

Personalized emails have a 2x higher response rate than generic emails.

### Professional image

Personalization shows that you've done your research and are addressing the right person.

## Available variables

### Standard variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| firstName | First name | John |
| lastName | Last name | Smith |
| email | Email | john@example.com |
| company | Company | Acme Corp |
| jobTitle | Job title | Sales Director |
| phone | Phone | +1 555 123 4567 |
| website | Website | https://acme.com |

### System variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| unsubscribe_link | Unsubscribe link |
| current_date | Today's date (local format) |
| current_year | Current year |

### Custom fields

Your custom fields are available as variables:

| Variable | Example |
|----------|---------|
| sector | Fintech |
| company_size | 50-100 |
| source | LinkedIn |

## Using variables

### In the subject

Example: `Hello firstName, quick question`

Result: "Hello John, quick question"

### In the content

```text
Hello [firstName],

I noticed that [company] is expanding in the [sector] sector.
As a [jobTitle], you must be facing...
```

Replace brackets with variable syntax using double curly braces.

### Insertion menu

1. In the email editor, place your cursor
2. Click on **Variables** in the toolbar
3. Select the variable to insert

## Default values (fallback)

If a variable is empty for a contact, you can define a default value with the syntax: `variable|default_value`

### Examples

- `firstName|there` → "John" or "there" if first name is empty
- `company|your company` → "Acme Corp" or "your company" if empty

## Best practices

### Always provide a fallback

Never leave a variable without a possible fallback to avoid emails with blanks.

### Check data quality

Before using a variable, ensure that:
- The field is filled for most contacts
- The data is clean (correct capitalization, etc.)

### Natural personalization

Avoid over-personalization that seems artificial. 1-2 variables per paragraph is enough.

### Test before sending

1. Use preview with different contacts
2. Send a test email to yourself
3. Check cases where data is missing

## Advanced personalization (Pro Plan)

### Conditional variables

Display text based on a condition. For example, display different text depending on whether the job title is filled or not.

### Formatting

Available formatting options:
- uppercase: Converts to uppercase
- lowercase: Converts to lowercase
- short: Short format for dates

## Template example

```text
Subject: [firstName], question about [company]

Hello [firstName],

I'm reaching out because [company] seems to perfectly
match the profile of companies we support.

Would you be available for a 15-minute exchange?

Best regards,

```

Replace brackets with variable syntax using double curly braces.

## Troubleshooting

### Variable displayed as-is

If the variable displays instead of the value:
- Check the variable spelling
- Verify the field exists for the contact
- Use the variable menu rather than manual entry

### Incorrect data

If "john" displays instead of "John":
- Clean your data at the source
- Use CSV import with clean data
- Manually correct important contacts

### Empty variable

If nothing displays:
- Add a fallback
- Verify the field is not empty for this contact
