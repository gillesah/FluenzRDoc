# Campaigns

Campaigns are at the heart of FluenzR. Create automated email sequences to engage your prospects in a personalized and effective way.

## What is a campaign?

A FluenzR campaign is an automated email sequence that:

- Sends personalized emails to your contacts
- Respects delays between each email
- Automatically stops if the contact replies
- Tracks opens, clicks, and replies

## Campaign components

### Visual workflow

The workflow editor allows you to visually create your sequence:

```
[Start]
    ↓
[Email 1] → "First contact"
    ↓
[Delay 3 days]
    ↓
[Email 2] → "Follow-up"
    ↓
[Delay 5 days]
    ↓
[Email 3] → "Last follow-up"
    ↓
[End]
```

### Node types

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Email** | Sends a personalized email |
| **Delay** | Waits X days/hours before the next node |
| **Condition** | Branches based on a criterion (Pro Plan) |
| **End** | Ends the sequence |

## Campaign states

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Being created, not active |
| **Active** | Currently running |
| **Paused** | Temporarily suspended |
| **Completed** | All contacts have finished the sequence |

## Contact lifecycle in a campaign

1. **Added**: The contact enters the campaign
2. **In progress**: The contact progresses through the sequence
3. **Replied**: The contact replied → Sequence stopped
4. **Completed**: The contact received all emails
5. **Unsubscribed**: The contact unsubscribed
6. **Error**: Sending issue (bounce, etc.)
