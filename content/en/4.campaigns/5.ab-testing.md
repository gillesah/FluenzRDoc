# A/B Testing

A/B testing allows you to compare different versions of your emails to identify what works best.

> **Info**
A/B testing is available starting from the **Starter** plan.

## What is A/B Testing?

A/B testing (or split testing) consists of:
1. Creating two versions (A and B) of an email
2. Sending each version to a portion of your contacts
3. Measuring which version performs better
4. Using these learnings for your future campaigns

## What you can test

### Email subjects

The most impactful element on open rate.

**Test examples:**
| Version A | Version B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Quick question | {{firstName}}, quick question |
| Improve your sales | 3 techniques to double your sales |
| Invitation | You're invited |

### Email content

Impact on click and response rate.

**Test examples:**
- Length (short vs detailed)
- Tone (formal vs conversational)
- Structure (paragraphs vs lists)
- CTA (call-to-action)

### Sender

The sender name influences opens.

| Version A | Version B |
|-----------|-----------|
| John Smith | John from FluenzR |
| FluenzR Marketing | john@fluenzr.co |

## Create an A/B test

### 1. Enable A/B test

In the workflow editor:
1. Click on an Email node
2. Enable the **A/B Test** option
3. A version B is automatically created

### 2. Configure versions

**Version A:**
- Fill in subject A
- Write content A

**Version B:**
- Click on the "Version B" tab
- Fill in subject B
- Write content B

### 3. Define distribution

| Parameter | Description | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Distribution** | % of contacts for each version | 50/50 |
| **Success criterion** | Metric to optimize | Open rate |

### 4. Option: Automatic winner sending

Enable this option to:
1. Test on a sample (e.g., 20% of contacts)
2. Wait for results (e.g., 24h)
3. Automatically send the winning version to the remaining 80%

## Comparison metrics

### Open rate

Relevant for testing subjects.

| Version | Sent | Opened | Rate |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| A | 500 | 125 | 25% |
| B | 500 | 175 | **35%** |

→ Version B wins (+40% opens)

### Click rate

Relevant for testing content and CTAs.

| Version | Opened | Clicks | Rate |
|---------|--------|--------|------|
| A | 125 | 15 | 12% |
| B | 175 | 14 | 8% |

→ Version A wins for click rate

### Response rate

The ultimate metric for prospecting.

| Version | Sent | Replies | Rate |
|---------|------|---------|------|
| A | 500 | 8 | 1.6% |
| B | 500 | 15 | **3%** |

→ Version B wins for replies

## Analyze results

### Statistical significance

A result is reliable if:
- The sample is sufficient (>100 per version)
- The difference is significant (>10% gap)
- The test lasted long enough (>48h)

> **Warning**
With small samples, results may be due to chance. Wait for enough data before concluding.

### Interpretation

| Gap | Interpretation |
|-----|----------------|
| <5% | No significant difference |
| 5-15% | Trend to confirm |
| >15% | Significant difference |

## Best practices

### Test only one element

To know what makes the difference, change only one thing:

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| Different subject + Different content | Only the subject |
| Everything is different | One variable at a time |

### Sufficient sample

| List size | Recommended test sample |
|-----------|------------------------|
| <500 | Test on 100% (50/50) |
| 500-2000 | Test on 50% |
| >2000 | Test on 20-30% |

### Test duration

Wait long enough for reliable results:

| Email type | Minimum duration |
|------------|------------------|
| Prospecting | 48-72h |
| Newsletter | 24-48h |
| Urgent | 12-24h |

### Document your tests

Keep a journal of your A/B tests:
- Starting hypothesis
- What was tested
- Quantified results
- Actionable conclusion

## Test ideas

### Subjects to test

| Element | Example A | Example B |
|---------|-----------|-----------|

## FAQ

### Can I do an A/B/C test?

No, FluenzR only supports 2-version tests. To test 3 options, run successive tests.

### Does the test work on follow-ups?

Yes, each email in the sequence can have its own A/B test.

### How are contacts distributed?

Randomly. Each contact is assigned to a version at send time.

### Can I modify a test in progress?

No, modifying a test in progress would skew the results. Create a new campaign if needed.
