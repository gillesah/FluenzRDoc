## Workflow best practices

### Recommended structure

An effective sequence:

```
[Start]
    ↓
[Email 1] - Introduction
    ↓
[Delay 3 days]
    ↓
[Email 2] - Value proposition
    ↓
[Delay 4 days]
    ↓
[Email 3] - Last chance
    ↓
[End]
```

### Optimal number of emails

| Campaign type | Recommended emails |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Cold prospecting | 3-4 emails |
| Nurturing | 5-7 emails |
| Event | 2-3 emails |
| Customer follow-up | 2-3 emails |

### Delays between emails

| Context | Recommended delay |
|---------|-------------------|
| Between email 1 and 2 | 3-4 days |
| Between email 2 and 3 | 4-5 days |
| Between email 3 and 4 | 5-7 days |

> **Warning**
Delays that are too short can annoy your prospects. Delays that are too long lose momentum.

## Conditional workflows (Pro Plan)

### Example: Follow-up based on open

```
[Email 1]
    ↓
[Delay 3 days]
    ↓
[Condition: Email 1 opened?]
   ├─ Yes → [Email 2: Personalized follow-up]
   └─ No → [Email 2: New angle]
```

### Example: Qualification based on click

```
[Email with 2 links]
    ↓
[Delay 2 days]
    ↓
[Condition: Click on link A?]
   ├─ Yes → [Email focused on solution A]
   └─ No → [Condition: Click on link B?]
              ├─ Yes → [Email focused on solution B]
              └─ No → [Generic email]
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl + Y` | Redo |
| `Delete` | Delete selected node |
| `Ctrl + D` | Duplicate node |
| `Ctrl + S` | Save |

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid workflow"

Verify that:
- All nodes are connected
- There are no loops
- Each branch ends with an End node

### "Email without content"

Each Email node must have:
- A non-empty subject
- Non-empty content

### Unconnected node

A grayed-out node or one with a red indicator is not connected. Link it to the workflow or delete it.
